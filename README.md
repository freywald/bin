## Example

![shell examples](https://github.com/freywald/bin/blob/master/documents/example.png?raw=true)

Format specification: ```'~'$USERNAME [if login type is 'remote', then: 'ðŸ–§'] 'at' $HOSTNAME ['as' $CHROOT_MESSAGE] Â· [if command 'git' is available && $CURRENT_WORKING_PATH is a git repository, then: 'head' $HEAD_STATUS Â· $REPOSITORY_STATE] Â· 'Î”s' $DELTA_TIME Â· 'at' $CURRENT_WORKING_PATH $END_SIGN```

## Installation (Five Step Exercise Human Evaluation Marathon)

1. ```$ git clone git@github.com:freywald/bin.git scripts && cd scripts && ./install```
   The scripts will be installed for the current user only. You may execute the install script again within *another* user context (yes â€“ to install the scripts for the *other* active user â€“ you're very, very smart). The old .bashrc and .bash_aliases â€“ if existing within interpreted tilde character context â€“ are backed up to your home directory. The tilde character looks like this **~**, please be aware of it for a few seconds, I hope you won't mind having it on your mind for a while, thanks, we know it's quite a burden, yes, we know it's hard, **sorry**. UwU, but you gotta keep it up, human.
2. You can delete the script folder which is created on git clone command during step 1 any time now if you're done. â€“â€“ And you're done, as you should know.
3. You may need to relogin to see the new shell customization in action.
4. That was fun, right? UwU
5.
